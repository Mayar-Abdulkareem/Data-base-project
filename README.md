# My Pets Store

The structure includes a JavaFX development with a Database management system, which can work integrally. a GUI design is supported to enables three kinds of users to deal with our petâ€™s store, the customers, employees, and admin. our JavaFX application provide the customers the ability to see, add to cart, order products, and tracking them. The employees could manage the store by adding, deleting, searching updating products, inserting the suppliers who provide our products, tracking and packaging orders, Admin could hire new employee, update their information, our application also provides generating reports of the sales/month which the admin can see only.  A lot of work done to make the application practical in the real world, with modern interfaces for users.

Ps: a word doc is uploaded including screenshots of all the interfaces, UML design and the requirement.
